## Introduction

To be written.

### Installation

This library is installable via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require brick/json-mapper
```

### Requirements

This library requires PHP 8.1 or later.

### Project status & release process

While this library is still under development, it is well tested and should be stable enough to use in production environments.

The current releases are numbered `0.x.y`. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), `y` is incremented.

**When a breaking change is introduced, a new `0.x` version cycle is always started.**

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as `0.1.*`.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history](https://github.com/brick/json-mapper/releases) for a list of changes introduced by each further `0.x.0` version.
